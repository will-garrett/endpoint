Hi Aaron,

My apologies, I thought this coding test would be timed a little differently. I am happy to submit another code test if you have a problem with accepting this late, I was just unaware of the time restrictions being conducted in this manner. 

If you are able to look past this oversight. This readme is to serve as a record of when I first started, approximately 7:45.
